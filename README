xkcd
----

A simple wrapper around xkcd's JSON interface, written in `go'.

To install, run:
    $ go get "github.com/clickyotomy/xkcd"

For documentation*, go here: https://godoc.org/github.com/clickyotomy/xkcd.

[*] Note: The `godoc' might not work at the time of writing, because there
          is no support for `go-modules', yet.
